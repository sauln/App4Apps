I've written apps for Fandango, Intuit, and have advised companies such as Starbucks. Now I'm offering you the chance to take control of your finances this new year with the ONLY personal finance app giving you Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) features on your pre Ice Cream Sandwich device. Moola!
<p>Easily track your finances, all in one place in this smart, sleek, super sexy digital checkbook/expense tracker/bill reminder.</p>
<p>Feel good knowing that you aren't giving away all of your personal information in exchange for a "free" app. So called "free" applications collect your information and share it with advertisers. With Moola your information stays local to the app, and is not shared with advertisers. No websites to sign up with, no bothersome emails.</p>
<p>Competitors:<br>Many Android developers feel that the App Store is crippled with a race-to-the-bottom mentality, pricing apps far below a reasonable, sustainable value level. Thats absolutely true. Shame on you for pricing at $0.99 to chase the kind of customers who, well, think a dollar is anything but a trivial, throwaway amount of money that wont even remotely get you a reasonable cup of coffee. Get some self-respect. Quit encouraging bad behaviour, and ruining the party for everyone else. A price-tag of one dollar is passive smoking. Youre killing people around you, for your own short-term benefit.</p>
<p>For less than the price you spend on food in one day, my app can help you organize and track your money and bills all year long. See your banks, credit cards, and bills in one simple, streamlined application. Control where your money goes and get important real-time alerts and reminders about your accounts. Moola is safe and secure, and unlike other financial apps, does not require sensitive banking information.</p>
<p>Also, unlike other financial software packages, there is no subscription fee(s) and you don't need to keep buying the "new" version every year. Once you buy my app, it's yours for life, and you will continue to get updates, and improvements to EXISTING features. New features will be paid as they require significant investment of time and/or money from the developer. Like any business, there are costs associated with developing the product. Before leaving me one star and complaining in the comments, realize what you are asking of me, and ask yourself if you would work for free.</p>
<p>A quick note about sync. There's been a lot of people asking for this. I would love to do it, but it would cost me more to maintain the server, than what I make from this app. Storing data on the cloud costs money, lots of money, and there are tons of security issues involved. To keep the app cheap, there's no sync.</p>
<p>Key features:<br> Track all your money and bills in one place<br> Receive bill due date reminders<br> Password lock<br> Get important account notifications<br> View detailed bill &amp; account statements<br> Add an unlimited number of accounts<br> Customizable categories<br> View spending habits by category, subcategory, and payee<br> Data import/export/backup<br> Enjoy well deserved financial peace of mind</p>
<p>Extra (Paid) Features:<br> Budgets</p>
<p>GET OUT OF DEBT!<br>This app helps you keep track of your money and bills, giving you a simple overview of your cash, bills, and credit card debt. Once you understand what you owe, you can find ways to budget your money better. Control your spending and bills due with transaction history, and never miss a bill with push notifications.</p>
<p>STOP OVERDRAFTING<br>Stop giving away your hard earned money to your bank! Banks hold your real account balance hostage in the hopes of charging you outrageous overdraft fees because you failed to manage your money properly. </p>
<p>Don't use an app that downloads information from your bank, as it will not have accurate real-time information about your accounts. Credit/debit card purchases could take days to post to your accounts, and if you live on a tight budget you run great risk of overdrafting and shelling out big bucks to your bank.</p>

Light Check lets you generate images of checks from any checking or draft account.  
<p>You can use them to pay anyone who has a remote deposit feature on their bank, including smartphone apps with camera deposit, or direct banking accounts that let you upload check images to the web.</p>
<p>The app does not connect to the internet, and no third party account is required, so your confidential payment information remains safe.</p>
<p>The checks are generated using the United States standard for check formatting.  All you need is a blank check, or your account information from your bank.  Enter the information into Light Check, including the account holder's name and address, and the routing and account numbers.  Then draft a check for a certain amount to a recipient and sign the check.   Saving specific account information is optional, and no information ever leaves your device, except to your trusted payment recipients.</p>
<p><br>For visual payment in person, 7" and 10" high resolution tablets work best.  For devices above 7", a screen pixel density of more than 120 ppi is recommended.  For devices above 3.5", a screen pixel density of more than 200 ppi is recommended.</p>
<p>Some banks treat remote deposits differently.  You can test Light Check with your bank using the Light Check Lite free application which will only draft checks for $3.50.  We can't guarantee your specific bank will accept LIght Checks right away, but if you contact us with any problems, we will try our best to rectify any rejections.</p>

My Weekly Budget (MyWB) lets you focus on a simple spending target for the current week. Focusing week-by-week on keeping within a spending target helps you meet your budget, and saves you money over time. When using MyWB consistently, it is easy to stay within your means because you are being updated on your spending each time you buy something. 
<p>This App is easy to use and easy to understand. It is SIMPLE but powerful. First, set yourself a weekly budget target. Then enter your spending with a uniquely simple, straight forward interface and instantly see whether you are meeting your budget. MyWB also shows you how much of your set budget you have at any given day of the week. The goal of this App is to help you control your spending with minimal effort. </p>
<p>The App is flexible enough to allow you to customize features to match your needs. There is also a quick and easy way to flick through your spending patterns from previous weeks - so you can get a clear view of where you have been spending your money. </p>
<p>At the end of each week, a brief summary for the week is presented showing how well (or badly?!) you have done against your target. Any money not spent may be carried over to the next week, so you can reward yourself with higher spending next week! Any money you received (birthday presents, cash-back on a pair of shoes you returned etc.) may also be added to your current week's spending plan if you choose. </p>
<p>MyWB supports your local currency and several other international currencies. You can show the date format to your liking, organize spending in categories as broad or as focused as you want, and includes the option to make your own categories to show personalized descriptions of your spending. </p>
<p>You can also export your spending information from MyWB by email so you can use it in other applications on your computer. </p>
<p>Do you find money slipping through your fingers? Not knowing where your hard-earned cash goes? Maybe you just need an occasional message to remind you what you were planning to spend this week? This is the App for you! </p>
