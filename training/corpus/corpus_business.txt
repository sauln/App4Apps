Judge Robert Restaino jailed 46 people when a mobile phone rang in his courtroom and no one admitted responsibility. So we invented Locale!
<p>Locale's advanced artificial intelligence manages settings automatically. For example: arrive at work and instantly your ringer silences, your wallpaper snaps to that scenic Caribbean photo, and Wi-Fi switches on. With Locale, never worry about your ringer going off accidentally again. Once you experience Locale's power and convenience, you'll never want to be without it. Set it and forget it!</p>
<p><br>LOCATION<br>Locale leverages patent pending artificial intelligence geofencing algorithms for instant location detection.</p>
<p>Configuring is simpleit just works! To create a geofence location, drag and drop the pin on the map, resize the radius using your finger, and Locale does the rest. </p>
<p>The best part? No battery drain. Locale's sophisticated sensor fusion technology combines accelerometer, cell, Wi-Fi, GPS, and other signals for optimal accuracy, performance, and battery life. During our extensive testing across dozens of popular Android devices, we found Locale's typical battery impact too small to even measure.</p>
<p><br>PLUG-INS<br>Locale manages more than your ringer. Along with built-in conditions (Battery, Calendar (Android 4.0+), Caller, Location, Orientation, Time) and built-in settings (Bluetooth, Display Brightness, Display Timeout, Ringtone, Volume, Media Volume, Shortcut, Wallpaper, Wi-Fi), Locale expands with an advanced plug-in architecture. Over 500 plug-ins for Locale exist on Google Play.</p>
<p><br>SUPPORT<br>With Locale, you get what you pay for: Locale is fast, accurate, reliable, secure, and battle tested. We stand behind our app 100%. Have a question? Just ask!</p>
<p>Looking for troubleshooting information and tips about how to use Locale?

<p>Locale is tested and fully compatible with all of the latest Android versions (including Android 4.4 KitKat) and devices (including the Nexus 5, Galaxy S 4, and HTC One).</p>
<p><br>BUZZ<br>Locale won the grand prize of Google's Android Developer Challenge, because it is one of the coolest apps for Android and showcases what the Android platform can really do.  This is what people are saying:</p>
<p>"I'm really taken with Locale. [...] The idea that I have an intelligent phone that configures itself depending on where I am is very powerful."<br>  - Fred Wilson, principal of Union Square Ventures</p>
<p>"Locale has a lot going for it. It's easy to use, but has some advanced functionality under the hood. We have found the battery usage to be absolutely amazing. [...] We feel the level of polish and overall quality are more than commensurate with the asking price."<br>  - Ryan Whitwam, Tested.com</p>
